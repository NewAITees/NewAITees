## Programming Activities
I'm involved in programming activities mainly related to AITuber, generative AI, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Examples
- [TaskMateAI](https://github.com/NewAITees/TaskMateAI)
    - AI task management tool: A web application that streamlines task management for AI agents
- AItuber applications: AI response generation systems for Virtual YouTubers
- Generative AI tools: Image generation assistant tools utilizing generative AI models like Stable Diffusion

## Streaming Activities
I'm currently streaming AITuber, generative AI, and AI Coding activities on Twitch.
If you follow my channel, I'll gift you one AI-generated image.
